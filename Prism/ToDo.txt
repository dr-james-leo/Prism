I think it is all working, now start to use.

Goal
====
Starting from an empty DB.
1. Create the Grades of a consultant.
2. Create the consultants.
3. Add the grades to the consultant (can this be done at time of creation of the consultant too?)
4. Create a client
5. Create a project for a client.
6. Assign consultants to the project (can this be done at the time of creation of the project too?)

Actions
=======

1. Created Grades1Controller with views.
http://localhost:50197/grades1 lists all the grades
When creating a grade, we can't duplicate the grade level. Ensure it is unqiue!

Need to add logging next.  Log to db so we can have multiple servers
